## Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge

I went to Rocky Mountain Arsenal searching for a good skyline shot and found this little guy. With bison in the area, the Refuge asks you to stay in the car at all times here, which made framing this a challenge. Lots of inching along the road the get the prairie dog and skyline lined up here.
