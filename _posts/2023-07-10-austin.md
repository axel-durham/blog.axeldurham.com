## An Austin Trip

I visited Austin during a heat wave, 105 degrees that felt like 120 with the humidity. I'd resented the humidity when I lived there, but after living in bone-dry Denver these past few years, I realized I miss it. The city felt so full of life. Trees and bushes and and green lawns that just existed that way.

I came across this stop sign, surrounded in pink flowers, on a drive through town.

PS - an obligatory shot of the UT tower.
